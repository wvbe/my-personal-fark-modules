# my-personal-fark-modules

This is a personal project and quite possibly of no use to you. However, it may be a good example of how to sauce your
own [fark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fark) module. Obviously, to run this you need to have `fark` installed.

To install, clone this project as ".fark" in your user home directory.
